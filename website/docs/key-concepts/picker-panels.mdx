One of Floe's core goals is to provide a fast and fluid way to find and load sounds across large sound pools: the _pickers_ are the main way to do this.

You may spend a lot of time with the pickers. They're used in several places on the interface:
- Presets
- Instruments for each layer
- Impulse responses for the Convolution Reverb effect

They all largely work the same way, with some minor differences depending on context.

## Filter and result design

The fundamental design is a two-panel layout: filters on the left, and results on the right (loadable items).

Similar to if you were shopping online for t-shirts: you might use filters to narrow down the results by size, colour, price range, etc., and then browse the results that match your criteria. 

The same principle applies here, except we use filters such as library, tag, or folder to instantly narrow down results of presets, instruments, or impulse responses.

By default, we start simple - you can only select one filter at a time; if you click on another filter, it replaces the existing one. You can change to a multi-select mode using the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical" /> menu in the top-right.

When no filters are applied, all items are shown in the results list.

- **1**: filters panel: filters to narrow down the results. Here we can see filters for libraries (Celtic Harp, Dulictone, Lost Reveries, etc.) and folders within those libraries (Core, Extras, Mic Options, etc.).
- **2**: the results list, showing items that match the current filter settings. Click these to load them.
- **Search libraries/tags**: filters search box: type here to narrow down the available filters.
- **Search instruments**: results search box: type here to filter the results list by name.
- **Favourites**: on each item in the results list you can click the <FAIcon icon="fa-regular fa-star" /> star that appear on the right when you hover over an item. This adds it to your favourites list, which can be accessed using the _Favourites_ button.
- **Left/right arrows** <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-caret-left" /><FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-caret-right" />: navigate to the previous/next item in the results list.
- **Random icon** <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-shuffle" />: load a random item from the results list.
- **Location arrow** <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-location-arrow" />: scroll to the currently loaded item in the results list.
- **Menu icon** <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical" />: open the menu to change between single/multi select modes.
- **Unload instrument**: unload the currently selected item. You can also click again on the loaded item in the results list to unload it.

## Filter button types
Filters come in 2 main styles: cards and buttons. Whilst they look quite different, they function in the same way - they narrow down the list of results on the right panel. The difference is that cards are larger, contain more information, and can house a tree structure of sub-items.

### Filter cards
Cards are used for sample libraries in the instrument and IR pickers, and for preset banks in the preset picker.

<NumberedOverlay
    src="/images/filter-card.png"
    alt="Picker Filter Card"
    overlays={[
    ]}
    boxes={[
        { number: 1, top: "2%", left: "2%", width: "96%", height: "28%" },
        { number: 2, top: "31%", left: "2%", width: "96%", height: "67%" },
    ]}
/>

Cards are made up of two sections, the _header_ (**1**) and the _body_ (**2**). 

Click on the header (**1**) to select the entire sample library or preset bank: 
![Filter card all selected](/images/filter-card-all-selected.png)

Alternatively, click on individual items in the body (**2**) to select specific folders within the library or bank:
![Filter card single item selected](/images/filter-card-body-item-selected.png)

Items in the body are hierarchical, if you select a parent folder, all child folders are also selected.

### Filter buttons
The other type of filter buttons are simple buttons used for tags, authors and other flat lists.

## Multi-select mode
By default, the pickers are in single-select mode: clicking on a filter replaces the existing selection.

Use the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical" /> menu in the top-right to switch to multi-select mode.

- **AND** mode means that all selected filters must be matched for an item to appear in the results list. The more filters you select, the narrower the results become.
- **OR** mode means that items matching any of the selected filters will appear in the results list. The more filters you select, the broader the results become.
