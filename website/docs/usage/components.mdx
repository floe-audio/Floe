Since Floe is sample-based, its uses various components to manage all the audio content.

This overview may help you understand how things fit together.

## Packages
A package is the portable distribution container used by Floe. It's exclusively used as the format for **downloading and installing content**. It's a Zip file with a specific internal structure. Packages are installed using Floe's _Install package_ button (or manually).

Within a package, there can be:
- Samples Libraries
- Presets/Preset Banks

Typically, a package contains one sample library, and a bank of factory presets for the library.

But alternatively, a package could also contain only presets, or a collection of sample libraries, or any combination.

Floe doesn't remember packages after installation; they're just a means to get content onto your computer.

## Sample Libraries
Sample libraries are collections of mapped, playable sounds along with images, tags, and other metadata. Without sample libraries, Floe is empty.

Sample libraries often have a theme or focus, such as 'Music Box Suite' — multisampled music box instruments, or 'Lost Reveries' — a collection of ambient single-sample ambient tones.

A sample library can contain:
- Instruments
- Impulse Responses

Sample libraries are not loaded directly; instead you load the instruments into Floe's layers, or impulse responses into Floe's convolution reverb. However, you can view your installed libraries by clicking the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-info-circle" /> info button on Floe's main window.

Libraries typically focus on instruments, however, sometimes a sample library exclusively contains impulse responses for use in the convolution reverb - expanding the options for sound design.

At a technical level, Floe sample libraries are open, portable folders of audio files and configuration files developed with Floe's [developer tools](/docs/develop/develop-libraries). You have full access to the audio files if you wish.

## Instruments
An instrument is a playable sound source. It might be something like 'Upright Piano' or 'Ambient Drone'. It might be a single sample that loops, or a multisampled instrument with many samples mapped across the keyboard along with velocity layers and round robins.

Instruments are loaded into any of Floe's [3 layers](/docs/usage/layers) using a powerful _[picker panel](/docs/usage/picker-panels)_ which lets you easily find instruments across all your installed libraries. A layer that has no instrument loaded will say 'None' instead of the instrument name - click this to open the picker.

## Impulse Responses
An impulse response (or IR) is a sample that determines the character of the convolution reverb. These are selected on the convolution reverb effect.

IRs can be chosen using a _[picker panel](/docs/usage/picker-panels)_ similar to the instrument picker, allowing you to easily find the right IR to shape your sound.

## Presets
A preset is a full production-ready setup of all of Floe's instruments and parameters, along with a name, description, and tags.

A preset bank is a collection of presets given a name and organised into categories.

Presets typically only use instruments and impulse responses from a single sample library. However, using any installed instruments and impulse responses is supported.

At a technical level, presets are just portable files (`.floe-preset`) arranged into folders on your computer. You can rename and organise them as you wish - Floe will automatically detect changes in its [preset folders](/docs/usage/folders).
