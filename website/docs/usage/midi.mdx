## Map parameters to MIDI CC

All automatable parameters in Floe can be assigned to a MIDI CC. This allows you to control Floe from a MIDI controller for example.

To do this, right-click on the parameter you want to assign, and select 'MIDI Learn'. Then move the control on your MIDI controller that you want to assign to that parameter. This will create a mapping between the parameter and the MIDI CC. 

You can remove this mapping by right-clicking on the parameter and selecting 'Remove MIDI Learn'.

This mapping is saved with your DAW project. But it's not permanent. It only applies to the current instance of Floe in your DAW, and it won't be the applied if you load a new instance of Floe.

Preset files do not save MIDI CC mappings. So you can load presets and your MIDI CC mappings will remain.

## Make MIDI CC mapping more permanent

You can make the MIDI CC mapping more permanent by right clicking on a 'MIDI learned' parameter and selecting 'Always set MIDI CC to this when Floe opens'. As the name suggests, when you open Floe, the MIDI CC mapping will be added.

## Default MIDI CC mappings

Floe sets some default MIDI CC mappings for you. You can turn this off in the preferences. The default mappings are:
{data["default-cc-mappings"]}

## Sustain Pedal

Floe supports sustain pedal control via MIDI CC-64. When the sustain pedal is pressed, currently held notes will continue playing even after key release, until the pedal is released. This mimics standard piano sustain pedal behaviour.

## Pitch Wheel

Floe supports the MIDI pitch wheel. The extend of the pitch bend can be configured individually for each layer by using the pitch bend range parameter on the Play tab of each layer. This per-layer configuration allows for interesting sound design possibilities. A pitch bend range of 0 will disable pitch bend for that layer.

## Velocity

Each layer has a customisable velocity-to-volume curve that maps how hard you play (MIDI velocity) to the layer's volume. This serves two main purposes: configuring the volume response that works best for your keyboard, and creating creative sound design opportunities when different curves are used across the 3 layers.

### Editing velocity curves

Find the velocity curve editor on the **Play tab** for each layer. The curve shows velocity input (horizontal) mapped to volume output (vertical).

- **Double-click** anywhere on the curve to add a control point (up to 6 per layer)
- **Drag control points** to move them
- **Drag between points** to adjust curve shape
- **Double-click a point** to remove it
- **Right-click** for menu options
