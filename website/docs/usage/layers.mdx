Floe is built around an architecture of three layers. These are displayed in three columns starting from the left of the main panel. Each layer is identical. Floeâ€™s layers are the first things in the processing chain; each layer is processed in parallel, and then the three streams of audio are mixed together and fed through the effects rack, from top to bottom.

## Sound shaping

You can shape the sound of each layer in quite a few ways.
