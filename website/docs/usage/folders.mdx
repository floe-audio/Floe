TODO: explain how to manage folders for libraries and presets

## Library folders

![Folder Preferences GUI](/images/folder-preferences.png)

Floe automatically scans for sample libraries in a set of folders. You can configure these folders in Floe's preferences panel, which is opened by clicking the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" /> cog icon at the top of Floe's window. Subfolders are scanned too.

The default library folder cannot be removed, but you can add and remove any other folders you like.

## Moving and rearranging libraries

You may rearrange your libraries within your folders as you see fit. Floe will automatically detect changes and apply them. For example, you might want to create subfolders for different types of libraries, or to separate libraries from different developers.

You can also move your existing libraries to another location, such as an external drive. 

To do this, you will need to move the libraries in File Explorer/Finder, and then add the new location in Floe's preferences.

Here's that process in more detail:
1. Create your new library folder at your desired location. For example, create "Floe Libraries" somewhere on your external drive.
1. Open the Preferences panel by clicking the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" /> cog icon at the top of Floe's window.
1. Under 'Folders', click on the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-external-link" /> link button for the folder that you want to move libraries out of. A File Explorer/Finder window will open.
1. Use File Explorer/Finder to move the libraries to your desired new location (libraries are folders â€” typically with this naming pattern: 'Developer - Library-name').
1. Go back into Floe, and add the new location by clicking the 'Add Folder' button. Remember, Floe will find libraries inside subfolders as well as the top-level, so select the "Floe Libraries" folder (or whatever name you chose), instead of the individual library folders.

## Preset folders

Floe automatically scans for presets in a set of folders - including subfolders. This works in the exact same way as your [library folders](/docs/usage/sample-libraries).

Presets are tiny files and so there's typically no need to move then to an external hard-drive.
