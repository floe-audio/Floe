Floe has a selection of {data["effects-count"]} effects that can be applied to the audio. These effects are applied to the mix of the three layers. The effects are shown in a list on the right-hand side of the main panel. 

## Reordering

You can change the ordering of the effects by dragging and dropping the effect names â€” either the name in the rack or the name next to the on/off switch.

## Available effects

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {data.effects.map((effect, index) => (
      <tr key={index}>
        <td>{effect.name}</td>
        <td>{effect.description}</td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>
