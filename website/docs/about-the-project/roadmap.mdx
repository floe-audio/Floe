Floe is an ongoing project that will have lots of backwards-compatible updates. We want to be able to release new features and improvements as soon as they're ready.

- Visit our GitHub [milestones page](https://github.com/floe-audio/Floe/milestones?sort=title&direction=asc) to see what we're currently working on and what's planned for the future.
- See our [changelog](/docs/changelog) to see what we've done so far.
- Give us feedback using [Github's discussions](https://github.com/floe-audio/Floe/discussions) section. FrozenPlain also have a Floe section on their [forum](https://forum.frozenplain.com/t/floe).

### Dreams
Thinking into the distant future, we're investigating ideas such as:
- Allow for creating custom GUIs 'views' using the library Lua API
- Adding a more comprehensive modulation system
- Add more features to the Lua sample library format to allow for more complex instruments: legato, key-switches, drums, etc.
- Adding wavetable oscillators/granular synthesis as an option to layer with sampled instruments
