# Beta Testing

Beta releases give you early access to new features and improvements before they're included in stable releases. While betas are thoroughly tested, they may not be as stable as official releases and could contain bugs or incomplete features.

Floe is an independent project, and your feedback helps us improve the software. If you encounter issues or have suggestions while using a beta, we'd love to hear from you.

## Feedback
There's many ways to provide feedback, please choose one that suits you best:
- Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/floe-audio/Floe/discussions). You will need a GitHub account to do this.
- Report bugs or issues on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/floe-audio/Floe/issues).
- Use the built-in 'Send Feedback' form in Floe itself (we're aware the text input is a bit clunky right now - it's on the roadmap).
- Reach out to Sam via email.

Take a look at the [blog](/blog) page - we sometimes post about beta releases there.

## How Beta Downloads Work

Beta downloads are available on the [download page](/download) when there's a beta release newer than the latest stable version. If no beta link appears, it means the current stable release is already the newest version available.

The download page lists all available files - read the filenames carefully and download the appropriate one for your system - you'll typically choose the 'installer' version rather than the manual-install version.

## Installation and Versioning

Beta releases install just like stable releases and will overwrite any existing Floe installation (whether beta or stable). If you want to return to the stable version after trying a beta, simply download and install the latest stable release.

Version numbers indicate release order: for example, v1.0.0-beta.2 is newer than v1.0.0-beta.1, but both are preview versions that come before the final v1.0.0 release.

## Beta Update Notifications

By default, Floe only checks for stable release updates. You can enable beta update notifications in the preferences panel by checking the option to receive latest-version checks for beta releases instead of just stable ones.
