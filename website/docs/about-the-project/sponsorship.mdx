# Sponsorship

Sponsoring Floe helps support its ongoing development and maintenance. As a sponsor, you can receive priority support and influence the direction of the project. Additionally, you can submit professional high-quality packages to the [Package Directory](/packages).

As another service, we can also help with converting or creating Floe sample libraries.

Please contact [Sam](mailto:sam@frozenplain.com) to discuss more details.
