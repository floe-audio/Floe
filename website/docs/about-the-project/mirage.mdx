Floe includes full compatibility with Mirage, a sample library platform developed by FrozenPlain from 2018 to 2024. Floe evolved from this foundation while expanding into open-source development and broader platform compatibility. 

## Technical Details

Mirage libraries use a custom `.mdata` binary format for storing samples and metadata. The **Mirage Compatibility package** provides additional assets such as images and audio files that were previously embedded within Mirage but are handled separately in Floe. This package is automatically included with FrozenPlain's Mirage-format products, but you can also [download Mirage Compatibility](/packages/mirage-compatibility) separately.

Floe automatically detects existing Mirage installations and loads libraries without requiring conversion or re-installation. Both Mirage and Floe can coexist on the same system without conflicts.
