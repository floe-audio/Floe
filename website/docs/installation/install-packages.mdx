Floe can install sample libraries and presets from ZIP files called _Floe packages_.

![Floe's GUI](/images/install-package-gui.png)

### At a glance

Download your package ZIP file(s). Don't extract them. Instead, click the 'Install package' button in Floe's Preferences panel. Direct it to the ZIP file.

### Full instructions

First, [install Floe](/docs/installation/download-and-install-floe) and open it in your DAW.

Download your chosen package(s) (ZIP files containing sample libraries and presets). **Don't extract them.**

To install:
1. Open Floe's Preferences panel (<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" /> cog icon)
2. Go to the Packages tab
3. Click 'Install package' and select your ZIP file(s)
4. Done - libraries/presets are immediately available

The package ZIP files can be deleted after installation. No restart required.

## Advanced Details

### Install to a custom location
1. Create custom folders using Finder/File Explorer such as "Floe Libraries" and "Floe Presets"
1. Add them to Floe's preferences under their respective heading
1. Select them on the Package _install folder_ menus

#### Full details
By default, Floe installs content to standard folders on your main drive. This can be changed though by selecting custom folders in the Preferences panel's Packages tab.

If you've not done this before, the dropdowns for _install folder_ menus might only show 'Default' locations. You need to first tell Floe about your custom folders and then select them here.

To do that, use your file browser program (Finder/File Explorer) and create the folder(s) where you want to keep Floe content and add them on Floe's preferences. 

Floe uses separate folders for sample libraries versus presets, so you might want to create one for each. For example, on your _SAMPLES_ hard drive, create folders: "Floe Libraries" and "Floe Presets". Add these 2 folders on Floe's preferences panels and select them as the default installation locations.

Further details about folder management can be found on the [Folders](/docs/key-concepts/folders) page.

### How 'Install package' works

Floe handles the installation process intelligently. It will check existing installations across all known folders, check for conflicts and handle upgrades. It will even detect if you've modified a library and give you the option to keep your modified version. It will ask you about skipping or overwriting if it needs too. It will never duplicate libraries unnecessarily.

### Manually installing

Instead of using the 'install package' button, you can manually install libraries and presets by extracting the ZIP file into the correct folders.

1. Extract the package ZIP file.
1. Open Floe.
1. Open the Preferences panel using the gear icon at the top.
1. Open the Folders tab.
1. Here you can control which folders Floe looks for libraries and presets in. Copy/move the contents of the package's Libraries into one of Floe's library folders, and the same for Presets into one Floe's presets folder.
1. Done. No need to restart Floe.

### Uninstalling packages
Floe doesn't track packages - they are just the installation format. However, you can uninstall libraries and presets. Visit the [Uninstalling](/docs/installation/uninstalling) page for full instructions.

### Mirage Compatibility
If the package is a [Mirage](/docs/about-the-project/mirage) library and you are getting errors about missing Mirage Compatibility, [download Mirage Compatibility Package.zip](https://github.com/FrozenPlain/floe-mirage-compatibility/releases/download/v1.1/FrozenPlain.-.Mirage.Compatibility.Package.zip) and install it like any other package.
