On Windows, Floe can be uninstalled using the standard method for uninstalling software, via the 'Add or Remove Programs' control panel. See the [Windows documentation here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98).

To uninstall Floe on macOS or Linux, you must delete Floe's files manually. Visit the [file locations](../reference/file-locations) page to find where Floe's files are located on your system. For each of these locations, delete the files and folders.

The key files to delete are the plugin files. However, you might also want to delete Floe's small additionally files for thoroughness.
