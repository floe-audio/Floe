Floe is an evolving project with frequent (optional) updates.

### How to update
To update Floe, simply [download and run the latest installer](/download). It will replace the old version in a backwards-compatible way.

Alternatively, if you manually installed Floe, install the latest files - replacing the old ones.

### Checking for updates
Floe can automatically check for available updates. It does this in a simple, non-intrusive way.

When a newer version is available, a red dot will appear on the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-info-circle" /> info button in Floe's window.

Clicking this will open the info panel and show you the options: ignore the update, or visit the download or changelog pages. Ignoring the update means the red dot will disappear until a newer version is available.

### Disabling automatic update checks
You can disable automatic update checks by unchecking the "Check for updates" option in Floe's preferences panel.

### Beta updates
There is also a checkbox on the preferences panel for receiving update notifications for the latest release, including if there's a newer beta version available. This is only recommended in certain situations. See the [Beta Testing](/docs/beta-testing) page for more information.
