# Download & Install Floe

Visit the [download page](/download) to get the installers for your operating system. This page provides detailed installation instructions for each platform.

<OSTabs>
  <OSPanel os="windows">
    ## Windows Installation
    To install Floe, download the installer from the [downloads](/download) page and extract it (normally double-click). Double click on the installer EXE file and follow the instructions.


    ### Alternative: Manual Installation (Advanced)

    Normally you'll want to use the installer, but there could be some cases where you'd prefer to install Floe manually. To allow for this, we provide a zip file that contains Floe's plugin files; these can also be found on the [downloads](/download) page. Extract it and move the files to your plugin folders.

    - **CLAP:** Move `Floe.clap` into `C:\Program Files\Common Files\CLAP`
    - **VST3:** Move `Floe.vst3` into `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`
  </OSPanel>
  
  <OSPanel os="macos">
    ## macOS Installation
    To install Floe, download the correct installer for your Mac from the [downloads](/download) page. Double-click it to extract it, and then double click the PKG installer program and follow the instructions. You must install to your MachintoshHD harddrive (libraries and presets can be installed to other locations).

    You must choose the right download for your machine:
    - **Apple Silicon** (M1, M2, M3, etc.): Most Macs since late 2020
    - **Intel**: Most Macs before late 2020

    See [Apple's documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943) for help determining your Mac's processor type.

    ### Alternative: Manual Installation (Advanced)

    Normally you'll want to use the installer, but there could be some cases where you'd prefer to install Floe manually. To allow for this, we provide zip files that contain Floe's plugin files. Extract them and move the files to your plugin folders.
    - **CLAP:** Move `Floe.clap` into `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP`
    - **VST3:** Move `Floe.vst3` into `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3`
    - **AU:** Move `Floe.component` into `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components`
  </OSPanel>
  
  <OSPanel os="linux">
    ## Linux Installation
    To install Floe, visit the [downloads](/download) page and copy-and-paste the installation command into a terminal and run it. This command does this: creates the standard folder for plugins, downloads the Floe `tar.gz`, and extracts it to the plugin folder.


    ### Alternative: Manual Installation
    You can also do this manually if you prefer by downloading the manual-install file from the [download](/download) page and extracting it to the relevant folder:
    - **CLAP:** Move `Floe.clap` into `~/.clap` or `/usr/lib/clap`
    - **VST3:** Move `Floe.vst3` into `~/.vst3` or `/usr/lib/vst3` or `/usr/local/lib/vst3`
  </OSPanel>
</OSTabs>

## After Installation

### Updating Floe
You can replace old versions with new ones and everything will continue to work. To update Floe, just download and run the latest installer again.

### What's Next?
