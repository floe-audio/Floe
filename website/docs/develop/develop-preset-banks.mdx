Floe's preset management is based around the familiar idea of files and folders on your computer.

Presets are saved as individual files using the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-floppy-disk" /> save button at the top of Floe's UI. These files can be freely renamed and put into subfolders; this is how categories and hierarchies are created in the preset browser.

## Preset Banks

A _preset bank_ is small, optional, extension to this concept. By creating a `floe-preset-bank.ini` inside a folder of presets, it becomes a preset bank, where the entire tree of presets in the folder and all its subfolders become more easily identifiable and can feature metadata such as a subtitle and ID. 

The preset bank file is a simple INI text file with the following fields - all are optional:

```ini
; A short and descriptive name for the preset bank.
subtitle = My Preset Bank Name

; Any kind of unique identifier. Typically you might use a reverse 
; domain style string. Used so Floe can identify the bank uniquely.
id = com.myname.mypresetbank

; A version number - just a single integer. When installing a 
; package, Floe can use this alongside the ID to determine if a bank 
; can be updated rather than installed to a new location. Versioning
; is only designed for simple additions/fixes. If you make major
; changes, it's probably better to create a new preset bank, 
; "My Bank 2", with a new ID.
minor_version = 1
```

You can create this INI file with any text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit. You just need to type in the various `field = value` with new lines between them.

## Packaging

Once you've created your folder of presets and (optionally) added a `floe-preset-bank.ini` file, you can ZIP it up for distribution.

Read about packaging on the [packaging](/docs/develop/packaging) page.

Essentially, rename your bank folder to something like `My Preset Bank`. Next, put that into a folder called `Presets`. Next, put `Presets` into another folder `My Preset Bank - Floe Package`, then right-click and ZIP that folder. You should now have a ZIP called `My Preset Bank - Floe Package.zip` with a subfolder `Presets` and you bank folder inside that. The resulting ZIP file will contain the structure that _Floe packages_ requires (Presets subfolder at the top level). Test your package by trying to install it using Floe's _Install package_ button. Refer to the packaging page for more details if needed.

## Best Practices
- Make presets all feel the same volume: the master peak meter on Floe's GUI should just be the yellow zone when the preset is played at its fullest.
- Give each preset a unique, descriptive name suggesting its tone or usage. Don't use all capital letters. Don't include a 'type' prefix such as "PAD - " or "LD - ".
- Add as many tags as is relevant to the preset. Read more about tags on the [tags and folders](/docs/develop/tags-and-folders) page.
- Keep the description short and ending with a period.
- Organise presets into folders using your file browser. You can rename presets and folders as you like. See the best practises for folders on the tags and folders page.
