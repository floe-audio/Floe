# Packages Page Submissions

Do you have a Floe package you'd like to add to the [Package Directory](/packages)? We're happy to help you get it listed.
- If you're familiar with development workflows, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/floe-audio/Floe/pulls) with a new entry to `package-database.json` following the schema below.
- Otherwise, please [contact us](https://github.com/floe-audio/floe/discussions) and we'll help add your package.

All packages must be compatible with the current Floe version and meet basic quality standards for audio, scripting, and presentation.
