Floe version 1.1 is now available with the browser improvements from the beta release and several important bug fixes. This update brings a smoother workflow for finding sounds and resolves issues that were affecting some users.

## Browser improvements

The main feature of this release is the overhaul of the browsers for selecting presets, instruments, and impulse responses. These changes were first introduced in the beta version and have been refined based on user feedback.

If you missed the beta release, here's a summary of the key improvements:
- New visual cards for sample libraries and preset banks with better organisation
- Simplified default filtering mode with advanced options available when needed
- Full keyboard navigation including arrow keys, page up/down, and shortcuts
- Favourites system for quick access to preferred sounds
- Right-click uninstall for libraries and preset banks

For full details on the browser changes and screenshots, see the [v1.1 beta announcement](/blog/first-beta-1-1-0).

You can also read the [comprehensive usage documentation for the browsers](/docs/key-concepts/browsers) which explains all features.

## Bug fixes and improvements

This release includes several fixes that improve reliability:

- **Audio loop improvements**: Fixed occasional pops at ping-pong loop boundaries and reduced audible artefacts when adjusting loop points during playback.
- **DAW compatibility**: Resolved loading issues in Reaper and FL Studio where the UI would appear correct but the audio didn't reflect the current state. Also fixed silent output in Ableton Live 10.
- **Convolution reverb**: Fixed presets becoming silent when the convolution reverb dry level was set to -inf dB.
- **Mirage preset volume**: Corrected an issue where some Mirage presets would load too quietly when using certain convolution reverb impulse responses.
- **Installation reliability**: Fixed a potential package installation failure and possible crashes related to file paths on Windows.
- **Faster audio loading**: Increased threading for loading audio samples to use up to 75% of CPU cores instead of a maximum of 4.

See the full [changelog](/docs/changelog) for all changes.

## Expanded documentation

Alongside this release, we've significantly expanded the documentation. The new Key Concepts section helps you understand how Floe works, with detailed guides on:
- [Components](/docs/key-concepts/components): Understanding packages, libraries, and presets
- [Folders](/docs/key-concepts/folders): Where Floe stores its files and how to manage them
- [Browsers](/docs/key-concepts/browsers): Complete guide to finding and selecting sounds
- [General usage tips](/docs/key-concepts/general-usage): Best practices for working with Floe

We've also added comprehensive documentation for [layer parameters](/docs/usage/layers), [file locations](/docs/reference/file-locations), and [randomisation](/docs/usage/randomisation).

The installation documentation has been restructured too, with clearer instructions for [installing Floe](/docs/installation/download-and-install-floe), [installing packages](/docs/installation/install-packages), and [uninstalling](/docs/installation/uninstalling).

## Download

You can download Floe 1.1 from the [download page](/download). If you're already using Floe, the update notification system will let you know this version is available.

As always, your libraries, presets, and settings are preserved when updating.
