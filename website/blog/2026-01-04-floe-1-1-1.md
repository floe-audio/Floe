Happy New Year! Floe version 1.1.1 is now available with a new monophonic mode, improved package installation for handling library updates, and several bug fixes. We're also releasing an updated version of the Celtic Harp package.

## Celtic Harp package update

We've released an update to the [Celtic Harp](/packages/celtic-harp) package. This is a backwards-compatible update that you can install right over your existing version using the 'Install Package' button in Floe's preferences.

What's new in this update:
- **Improved volume level**: The harp now better matches other instrument's level
- **Three new presets**: Each preset makes full use of macros for easy tweaking of the sound
- **Harp FX instruments**: Ascending and descending glissandos that were previously only available as FLAC files are now playable instruments in Floe
- **Vocal phrases**: Additional vocal content from the original Versilian Studios package is now available as Floe instruments

The Celtic Harp is a port of Etherealwinds Harp 2: Community Edition by Versilian Studios - a high-quality multisampled harp with velocity layers and round robins. It's completely free, though attribution is required if you use it in released work.

Download it from the [Celtic Harp package page](/packages/celtic-harp).


## New monophonic latch mode

The monophonic switch parameter has been replaced with a menu offering three modes: Off, Legato, and the new Latch option.

In latch mode, when you play a note, it continues playing until you release all keys. New key-presses while holding don't change the note - the original note keeps playing unchanged. It's particularly useful for non-pitched sounds that you want to play alongside tonal sounds in other layers.

## Improved package installation

We've enhanced the package installation system to better handle updates and conflicts. This work was done to support FrozenPlain's ongoing effort to update their Mirage libraries to native Floe versions.

When installing a package, Floe now:
- Supports upgrading preset banks based on version information
- Offers a 'keep both' option when encountering conflicts, giving you more flexibility
- Handles library updates more smoothly using library IDs, allowing names to be changed without breaking backwards compatibility

## Bug fixes

This release fixes several issues:
- **EQ parameters**: Fixed EQ parameters sometimes not being correctly applied when changing presets
- **Velocity curves**: Fixed some parameters not loading correctly
- **Layer voices**: Fixed voices duplicating when changing just one instrument at a time
- **Preset browser**: Fixed error displaying many unknown libraries
- **Installation**: Fixed possible hang when installing packages
- **end_frame**: Fixed incorrect loop end_frame when set in Lua as 0

## Other improvements

- Added new tags: 'fluctuating', 'ringing', and 'whining'
- Better icon for 'missing library' in the preset browser
- GUI now shows more decimal points with very slow LFO rates

See the full [changelog](/docs/changelog) for all changes.
