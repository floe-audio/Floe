Floe has a selection of {data["effects-count"]} effects that can be applied to mix of the 3 [layers](./layers). The effects are shown in a list on the right-hand side of the main panel. Audio flows through them from top to bottom.

## Reordering

You can change the ordering of the effects by dragging and dropping the effect names — either the name in the rack or the name next to the on/off switch.

## Notable effects
### Convolution Reverb
Floe's convolution reverb effect has numerous impulse responses (IRs) that explore both realism and sound-design. The IRs are selected using one of Floe's powerful _[browsers](../key-concepts/browsers)_, where IRs can be sourced from installed sample libraries that choose to provide them.

### Delay and reverb
Floe's reverb and delay are very high-quality, originating from Vital's pro-standard effects rack for excellent space design.
