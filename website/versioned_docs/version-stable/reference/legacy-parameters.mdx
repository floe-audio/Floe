# Legacy Parameters

To ensure that Floe maintains perfect backwards compatibility, we never remove or change parameters. When we want to improve or fix an existing parameter, we move the old parameter to the Legacy Parameters page rather than modifying it. This page is only needed if you have a DAW project with automation already set up for a parameter that has since become legacy. You can access legacy parameters by clicking the 3-dots menu, then selecting 'Legacy Parameters'.

As an example, we added a new mode for monophonic voice behaviour. Rather than changing the existing monophonic switch parameter, we added a new menu parameter that includes both the new mode and the old mode as options. Changing the existing parameter would have broken DAW projects that automated the switch parameter, because the automation would then be controlling a different set of values (a menu of items rather than just on/off), which might not behave the same way. Instead, we made the monophonic bool parameter legacy and created a new parameter in its place. If you have an existing DAW project, you can still access the old switch parameter on the Legacy Parameters panel to change or remove the automation.

The Legacy Parameters page is only needed if you are automating parameters in your DAW and set up this automation with an older version of Floe that now has newer parameters. Everything will work exactly as it did before. However, if you want to edit the patch further, it might be necessary to remove the automation from the legacy parameter, turn the legacy parameter off (set it to 'off' or 0), and then use the new parameter on the main UI instead.
