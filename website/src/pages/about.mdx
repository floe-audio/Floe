# About

Floe is a project by [Sam Windell](https://samwindell.name/), who also runs [FrozenPlain](https://www.frozenplain.com), a sample library company. Sam is passionate about software development, sound-design, and creating ethical, user-respecting toolsâ€”Floe is the manifestation of that drive. Released as free and open-source software and built with direct feedback from professional composers working in film and television, Floe embodies a commitment to performance, simplicity, and usability.

The goal is to create a unified platform where diverse sample libraries work seamlessly together, with sound transformation capabilities that bridge traditional sampling and synthesis.
