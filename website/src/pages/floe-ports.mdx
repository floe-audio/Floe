# Floe Ports
Floe Ports is the name of the community project for converting existing sample libraries into the Floe format, featuring images, icons, tags and other Floe-specific enhancements.

Floe is planning to support other sample library formats such as SFZ, but in order to make use of Floe-specific features such as tags and images, libraries will need to be manually converted.
