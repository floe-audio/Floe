# Floe FAQ

What follows is not really a result of frequently asked questions — though there is some of that — but rather an introspective look at the project and its goals. This document aims to build a foundation for understanding the project and its direction, and aid decision-making and communication.

## For Composers, Producers and Musicians

### What's the 'elevator pitch' for Floe?

Floe is the open, streamlined sample-based instrument platform that puts sound transformation at your fingertips — enabling composers to effortlessly find, perform, and reshape sounds beyond their natural boundaries in a plugin that is designed for longevity.

Every library shares the same consistent, familiar interface for sound-shaping parameters — no wild new approaches or gimmicks, just well-established tools that invite you to transform sampled instruments beyond their realism. Rather than laboriously building sounds from scratch, you start with rich timbres and shape from there. Load a preset for a production-ready sound, then effortlessly tweak it to your liking. Explore inspiring sounds and understand how they work, or precisely find what you need using comprehensive search, tags, and organisation.

Completely free with no catches and available on all major desktop platforms including Linux, Floe is your trusty tool for the meaningful creative act of music-making. It's complete but not completed — containing all the essential parts of a great product, with continuous refinement and expansion over time.

Floe is a passion project crafted with love by a developer & sound-designer who cares about the totality of product experience. Shaped by direct feedback from professional composers for film and television, it's not trying to be everything to everyone. Instead of being a traditional sampler or feature-heavy soft-synth, Floe offers a curated, streamlined approach to sample-based instruments focused on what matters: performance, simplicity, and usability.


### What does the Floe project aim to achieve?

Floe aims to provide highly-effective means for creating compelling music from sample-based instruments whilst encouraging and nurturing the joy of personal creative artistry.

### Who is Floe for?

Primarily, Floe is for composers, producers and musicians - from beginner to seasoned veteran. Both professionals on a deadline, and producers engaging in non-commercial creative artistry. People who already have a DAW and are expanding their sonic palette with sample-based instruments.

### What need does Floe fill for music-makers?

Floe provides a streamlined solution to finding, performing and transforming sample-based instruments in order to create compelling music with joy and ease.

### What exactly is Floe?

Floe is an audio plugin (CLAP, VST3, AU) for Windows, macOS and Linux that loads and plays sample libraries in the Floe format. It's a ROMpler or sample-based synthesiser more than a traditional sampler. It's the _platform_ for hosting (and creating) virtual instrument products — typically consisting of sample-based instruments and preset banks.

### What differentiates Floe from other sample library host for music-makers?

Floe puts sound-shaping features at your fingertips with a consistent, simple interface for all libraries - inviting you to make sounds your very own. It offers a complete package for sample-based instrument performance and sound-design and is optimised for quickly finding the instruments/presets you need across your entire collection using search, tags (mood, genre), favourites, etc. Floe provides sample-based synthesis features to transform sounds beyond their natural tone. Floe is open-source and free.

### What do people actually benefit from using Floe?

Using Floe, you get:
- Sample-library playback with the ability to instantly tweak sounds to your liking; envelopes, filters, effects are all at your fingertips
- Find the right sound quickly across all your libraries using search, tags (mood, genre), favourites, etc.
- The ability to transform sounds beyond their natural boundaries using sample-based synthesis techniques such as layering, extensive loop controls, LFOs and more.
- Solid, reliable software that is performant, free and designed for the long-term (10+ years)

It enables you to quickly and joyfully create music from sample-based instruments.

### Why might a composer/producer choose Floe over other samplers or soft-synths?

Ultimately, Floe is an engine; the host for Floe sample libraries. So the reason to use it is often is simply that it's the required host for the sample library that you want.

However, Floe has draw-factor beyond just being the host for a specific library. You might choose Floe because:
- Floe offers all the core features needed to tweak a sample-based instrument in a very simple way - it's all right at your fingertips: envelopes, filters, effects
- Floe offers a comprehensive system for quickly finding the sounds you need across all libraries: search, tags (mood, genre), favourites, etc.
- Floe allows all instruments to be transformed beyond their natural sound by using sample-based synthesis techniques such as layering, extensive loop controls and LFOs.
- Floe sample libraries are open - you have access to the audio samples
- It's totally free and open source nature - it's a long-term product optimising for 10+ years of service. Its open nature makes it resilient to dubious business practices.

### Who are Floe's users?

Floe's existing user base directly relate to FrozenPlain's user base, since FrozenPlain is the only company using Floe at the moment (Oct 2025). They consist of cinematic composers, whether that's film, TV or games - professional or amateur, and additionally, composers for ambient and meditation music. Their skill levels range from beginner to veteran composer. They often work in DAWs such as Logic Pro, Cubase, Studio One, FL Studio, Ableton Live, etc.

There's an additional growing audience of users who download Floe directly without first going through FrozenPlain. We have a very rough breakdown of operating systems used (based on data October 2025):
- Windows: 75%
- macOS: 21%
- Linux: 4%

### How could you succinctly summarise Floe and compare it to the leading competitor?

Floe is a sample-based product platform that lets you easily find, perform and transform sounds and take sounds beyond their natural tone with sample-based synthesis techniques.

This is different to something like Kontakt, because Floe is aiming to offer a complete-packaged, curated, streamlined experience for finding, performing and transforming sounds (via sample-based synthesis techniques) rather than a highly flexible, comprehensive toolkit for totally custom, hyper-realistic acoustic instrument emulations or other complex sample-based instruments. Floe is alive and always improving to meet the needs of its users - developed by a single passionate developer in close collaboration with professional composers.

### Alternative: Kontakt

Kontakt's key advantages:
- Completely ubiquitous in the industry of TV/film/game music production. Also widely popular in other music production. You'll find many sample libraries for it and lots of information about how to use it.
- Super advanced scripting allowing for very flexible creation of instruments and 'products' within the platform with custom GUIs, etc.
- Platform is open for anyone to create products for it - though the free Kontakt Player has time restrictions for many sample libraries - customers usually require the full version of Kontakt.

Kontakt's cons (which Floe addresses):
- It's £269 (though often available much cheaper via bundles or discounts). 
- The interface is sometimes clunky and outdated.
- Every major update is a cost.
- Slow updates and improvements - it took years for a search bar to be added for libraries, for example.
- It doesn't support Linux. 

Floe isn't directly trying to compete with Kontakt. Instead, Floe is aiming for a more universal, curated experience across all sample libraries. Rather than each library developing its own unique GUIs we want to focus on changes that benefit as many libraries as possible and converge on a well-designed experience rather than each library implementing similar features in frustratingly different ways. That being said, Floe is looking to eventually expand it's interface to support panels of more laser-focused controls for specific use-cases.

Floe is also not currently targeting the same level of advanced sampling features that allow for hyper-realistic acoustic instrument emulations. Instead, Floe is focusing on hybrid and abstract sound-design as well as simpler, less well-known acoustic instruments.

Floe wants to keep lots of sound-shaping features at your fingertips via common interfaces. Floe is totally free, and sample libraries built for it are open - you have access to the audio samples. Floe has a highly active development cycle with frequent updates that are always backwards-compatible. Floe's developer and visionary, Sam, knows intimately what's involved with feature development and maintenance as well as having composing and sound-design experience - resulting in an agile skill-set for rapidly iterating and improving the product without getting bogged down in corporate processes.

Floe offers a simple but powerful programming-based workflow for creating sample libraries allowing you to have control seldom possible with UI workflows. Kontakt also offers similar functionality with their new Kontakt Lua API scripts

### Alternative: Soundpaint

Soundpaint's key advantages:
- Highly advanced technology for realistic instrument emulations
- Loads of features for sample-based synthesis and sound-shaping
- Can easily import your own samples via a GUI
- Free

Soundpaint's cons (which Floe addresses):
- Steep learning curve with lots of new concepts to learn
- Unappealing UI style
- Closed platform with no access to internal workings or audio samples 
- Marketing acronyms and trademarks abound which perhaps distract from the core task of making music
- It doesn't support Linux

Floe's core goal seems somewhat similar to Soundpaint's - offer a consistent, powerful, curated experience for sample-based instruments. However, the approach is different. Floe has a different taste in terms of what simplicity means and how the GUI should look and behave: focusing more on well-known, familiar features rather than new concepts that may not offer a significant benefit. Floe provides a totally open platform with access to all aspects of the solution. Floe strives for an elegant, minimal aesthetic both in looks and in its marriage of audio processing and UI behaviour.

Floe offers a programming-based workflow for creating sample libraries, and standardised features for the entire creation and deployment of a product. Soundpaint seems to focus just on a UI for importing your own samples rather than a workflow for creating products for distribution.

### Alternative: Soundbox

Soundbox's key advantages:
- Loads of features for sample-based synthesis and sound-shaping
- Platform is open for anyone to create products for it
- MPE support
- Free

Soundbox's cons (which Floe addresses):
- No Linux support
- No programming-based workflow for creating libraries

Soundbox is another compelling platform for sample-based instruments with similar ideas to Floe. The key differences are that Floe is entirely open and free across the entire platform, it has a programming-based workflow for creating complex sample libraries products with flexibility (nearly impossible with UI-based workflows), and an agile and focused development process by a single passionate developer.

### Alternative: others
This section is incomplete. We could consider Descent Sample, sforzando, UVI Workstation, Musio, HISE, Rhapsody.

## For Software Developers

### Why is Floe using C++?

C++ was the most viable known choice at the time it was started. It was the language the developer had skills in and the plugin APIs required (VST and AU) are C++ based. Creating interfaces to another languages with these APIs would have been a lot of work. Nowadays, the CLAP API is C based and therefore interoperable with many languages, and the CLAP-wrapper project is a viable way to natively wrap CLAP plugins into VST3 and AU. But at this point (Oct 2025), the codebase is around 80k lines of C++.

### Why is Floe using Zig for the build system?

Zig provides easy cross-compilation allowing for rapid development of cross-platform software since you can compile for all platforms at once. It limits the number of tools needed to build the project making development more seamless across machines and CI - just Zig: a single, incredibly easy-to-install package - vs a compiler toolchain + a build tool such as CMake. It means the only compiler we need to support is Clang (which Zig uses internally to compile C++ code), as a result, we can fully lean into Clang-specific features and optimisations and completely disregard the need to be compatible with MSVC or GCC. It has an easy, integrated way to get packages and dependencies. It caters for writing build scripts in a real full-featured programming language. It paves the way for using Zig for the entire codebase in the future - a strong helper for keeping the project relevant for the long-term (10+ years).

### Why not JUCE?

While JUCE offers incredibly well-established abstractions for audio plugin APIs and GUI, it restricts the project to its way of doing things. When considering the long-term, it seems more prudent to have full control over such fundamental parts of an audio plugin since it allows for flexibility and adaptability in the case of changing requirements or environments. With using JUCE, we would somewhat be at the mercy of its development priorities, not our own. Crucially, JUCE appears to be optimising for a total, encompassing framework that commercial plugin developers can use to rapidly deploy audio software for their current needs - since this is where their money comes from. This is a slightly different goal to Floe's, which is fundamentally about serving our users' needs and being sustainable and adaptable for the long-term. Our choice of using dependencies therefore becomes a matter of careful delegation of specific tasks to well-chosen libraries, rather than a wholesale adoption of a framework.

### Why not use framework/library X?

We're happy to use well-chosen libraries for specific tasks. The reasoning behind our choices relate to: 
- Can we do it ourselves without too much effort - by doing it ourselves we understand the problem better and can tailor the solution to our exact needs and be more adaptable to possible future changes.
- Does it show strong evidence of robustness (comprehensive error handling, well-tested, evidence of use in production software, etc).
- Is its API malleable enough to be used as our application demands rather than requiring us to adapt our application to its way of doing things.

### Why use a custom GUI library?

The GUI is one of the fundamental parts of Floe. By using something deeply integrated into the codebase, we can always guarantee that we have the control to develop the experience that we want (the behaviour and performance characteristics). While GUI libraries can offer quick development speed and other advantages, they also inherently have limits that may not be surmountable. With Floe, we want the option to explore new ideas and approaches and be completely agile in the face of changing requirements. By having full control over the GUI (which is possibly the largest part of the codebase), we have more scope and experience to make a product that could have a 10+ year lifespan.

### Why not use the C++ standard library?

We use similar reasoning here for why we don't use JUCE, or library 'X'. Additionally:
- Slow compile times
- Lots of use of malloc-based new/delete, which doesn't fit into our preference for using arenas
- Use of exceptions, which we don't use

### What are the key principles that guide Floe's development?

- Focus on well-established, familiar functionality rather than new, unproven ones
- Consider the impact for the long-term; ensure sustainability over 10+ years
- Bug-free, reliable for professional use
- Available on as many major desktop environments as possible
- Highly performant for a smooth, delightful experience and to enable use on lower-end systems
- Backwards-compatible updates
- Don't bloat the interface with rarely-used features
- Keep the project nimble and adaptable to changing requirements
- Avoid messing around with users' workflows wherever possible

### What guides what features get added or improved?

- Feedback from users, including direct conversations from professional composers
- The needs of FrozenPlain's products since this is the funding source for Sam's development time on Floe
- What nurtures the joy of creative artistry - what effectively facilitates and encourages the meaningful creative act of music-making
- What improves professional composers' workflows for quickly and effectively delivering high-quality music on a deadline
- What improves Floe's primary dimensions: finding the right sound quickly, expressively performing it, and transforming it using sample-based synthesis techniques
- What improves Floe's long-term sustainability, adaptability, and CPU performance

### What business model can sustain Floe?

Floe is a platform for sample-based instrument products. These products can and should often be paid products due to the significant effort that goes into creating high-quality sample libraries. In-line with other sample library platforms that offer a free 'player', such as Kontakt, UVI Workstation, Soundpaint, Decent Sampler, Plogue sforzando, Soundbox, Floe itself is free since we want to offer a low barrier to entry for users - both providing access to free products and allowing users to try out the engine before buying a paid product. The business model is therefore a "razor and blades" model. However, unlike the usual case with this business model, Floe is not a closed platform - anyone can create Floe sample libraries and we offer extensive documentation about how to do so. Having a single, controlled platform for sample libraries allows us to fundamentally innovate and at the same time pass those benefits onto all products that use the platform.

The developer of Floe, Sam Windell, runs a premium sample library business called FrozenPlain. Floe's development is primarily funded by FrozenPlain's revenue, and as such, Sam's work on Floe is guided by the needs of FrozenPlain's products.

### What is the fundamental job of a Floe core developer?

The developer must work towards making Floe highly usable for its users - composers, producers and musicians; that means: bug-free, performant, available for all major OS/DAW, and with a well-designed user experience. That is the bedrock for any other innovations on top. The project will be impossible to recommend without these fundamentals in place.

The developer much consider the need for sustaining the necessary funding for software development hours. For now, this primarily comes via sales of FrozenPlain's sample libraries.

### Why is it free?

Floe's free nature ensures the lowest possible barrier to entry for users. It enables people to use Floe with free sample libraries, as well as try out the engine before buying a paid product. We want it avoid the disheartening situation where someone buys a product to only find out they need to buy an engine to use it. We feel that Floe being free is fair since Floe doesn't offer value in isolation - it's an engine rather than a product outright. Additionally, we want to provide people a professional-grade tool to encourage more beautiful music to be made - regardless of their financial situation.

### Why open source?

We believe being open source best serves our users. It ensures that the program is always subject to analysis as to whether it is rightly serving its users or if its engaging in shady practices. It nearly guarantees the longevity of the project since at any point in the future, developers can build it for new systems. It additionally leaves the door open for people to fork the project and change it to better serve their needs. To boil it down, being open source provides the best framework for ethical business and truly serving users.

## For Sample Library Developers

### Who is Floe for?

Secondarily, Floe is for sample library developers who have experience with programming and want to create sample-based instrument products.

### What need does Floe fill for sample library developers?

Floe provides a programmer-based workflow for creating sample-based instrument products for a standardised platform making use of extensive tagging and sample-based synthesis. It offers a standardised pipeline for creating sample-based instrument products.

### What types of sample libraries does Floe support?

At the moment (Oct 2025), Floe does not target hyper-realistic acoustic instrument emulations. Instead, Floe focuses on features to support unusual speciality instruments and synthetic sample-based instruments.

### Why might a sample library developer choose Floe over other sampler platforms?

Developers with experience with creating sample libraries and using programming languages can create products for the Floe platform. We offer extensive documentation on this. As it stands, the reason you might choose Floe for your product is:
- Programmers will probably love it and find it incredibly fast to develop libraries using the programming-based workflow to mapping and building sample instruments via the Lua scripting language - excellent for AI-assisted workflows, automation, version control, etc. A programming-first approach enables creating custom functions for sample-mapping, normalisation, pitch-correction, building instrument variations, etc.; a level of flexibility that cannot be achieved with UI-based sample-mapping tools.
- Totally free and open source nature, you can be more confident in its long-term future and not rely on a commercial entity. You can build and host your own version of Floe if you need to.
- Comprehensive documentation on how to download and use Floe (https://floe.audio).
- Offer your product on Linux.
- Explore sample-based synthesis techniques in your product such as layering, looping and LFOs.
- Benefit being part of an active, growing platform
- All fundamental multi-sampling features available such as round-robin, velocity layers.

This all being said, Floe is still a young platform and FrozenPlain is currently the only company using it. Floe does not support many of the more advanced sampling features that other platforms do. Experimentation in the platform is recommended before committing to it for a product.
