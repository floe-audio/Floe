# Previously known as Mirage

[Mirage](https://www.frozenplain.com/mirage) is FrozenPlain's sample library platform, developed from 2018 to 2024. 

Floe is Mirage's successor - an evolution of the same project with modern plugin formats, open-source development, and enhanced capabilities.

FrozenPlain are phasing out Mirage and transitioning to Floe.

## Install Mirage products
Mirage products use the same package format as Floe. They're _Floe packages_. Simply follow the same procedure to [install](../packages/install-packages.md) Mirage products as you would for Floe products.

**You must also install the Mirage Compatibility package**. Download it from the [packages page](../packages/available-packages.md).

## Phasing-out Mirage
FrozenPlain are upgrading their products to use the Floe-native format to make use of Floe's new features. These will be free updates.

## Why the name change?
The project has taken a new direction and so we decided to give it a new name.
- Floe is free and open-source, whereas Mirage was closed-source.
- Floe is not directly tied to FrozenPlain. It's a separate project that's open to anyone - we want to encourage growth of Floe without being tied to a specific company.
- Mirage is already the name of a hardware sampler from the 80s - we want to avoid confusion.

## Backwards-compatible with Mirage
Floe can load Mirage's libraries, presets and preferences file. If you have Mirage installed already, Floe will be able to find the same libraries and presets as Mirage. 

You can leave Mirage installed if you want to keep using it: Floe will not interfere with Mirage's installation.

Floe is a new plugin with a new name and new internals, targeting new plugin formats. Floe can't replace Mirage automatically in your old, saved DAW projects.

## What's new in Floe
Floe has an ever-growing list of new features and improvements over Mirage including: CLAP and VST3 support, combine sounds from multiple libraries at the same time, tags and filters, and easy library installation. See the [changelog](../changelog.md) for full details.
