# Available Packages

Floe can [install](./install-packages.md) libraries and presets from ZIP files called _Floe packages_.

This page showcases packages to help you get started with Floe.

## Floe Ports (free)
_Floe Ports_ is the name we've given to the community project of converting high-quality libraries from other formats into Floe's native format. Reach out if you want to help with this project, we'd love more presets for these libraries and more libraries converted.

For developers: Floe Ports libraries are available on [Floe's GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/floe-audio/repositories).

<div class="warning">

These are currently very basic.

They have just 1 instrument each and no presets.
